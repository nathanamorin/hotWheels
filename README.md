## Introduction

This project will design a C library for controlling a simple off-the-shelf RC car from a on board control unit with local internet access (i.e. raspberry Pi, Arduino).  This library will be demonstrated with a simple web based app that allows the RC car to be navigated through a preset obstacle course.  Below, this team has included the technical requirements for this project, a more detailed project description, next steps for this project, a list of physical components with links to potential products, and references to some preliminary research performed by this team.

## Requirements
* Wiring Pi http://wiringpi.com/ (Version Used Archived under <root>/etc/wiringPi)

## Usage Notes
* Compile hot wheels server with 
```gcc -o hotWheelsServer mongoose.c hotWheelsLib.c hotWheelsServer.c -lpthreads -lwiringPi```
* Run hot Wheels server with root privilages to run on web port 80.  NOTE: web socket can be configured in hotWheelsServer.c

## Documentation
